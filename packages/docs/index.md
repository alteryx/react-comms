UI-SDK is a React-based software development kit that lets you build custom applications to use within the Alteryx platform. 

The UI-SDK provides many product-specific messaging systems. You can use these across the Alteryx platform, as well as the entire core segment of the Alteryx Eclipse Components library.

The UI-SDK consists of three components. The communication bridge documented here, the Alteryx Component Library, and all associated walk throughs/help guides.
