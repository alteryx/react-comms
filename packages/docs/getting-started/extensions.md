#### Visual Studio Code

A snippet extension was developed for Eclipse Components. You can find it on the 
[Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alteryx.vscode-ui-core-snippets) or 
install it directly in the IDE via the Extensions tab as shown below:

Once installed, the extension is activated in all JavaScript/TypeScript files and is triggered by typing "uic-".
