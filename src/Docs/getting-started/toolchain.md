Alteryx's standard toolchain is [ayx-scripts](https://git.alteryx.com/ayx-ui/ayx-scripts). The project aims to produce standard build configurations for common JavaScript/TypeScript project types (e.g. frontend ui, backend services, sharable libraries, etc.). If you are familiar with react-scripts this is very similar. ayx-scripts is much simpler and adds AYX specific extras like copyright notices in bundles, our code linter packages, .npmrc config for Artifactory, etc.

### Installation
```js static
npm install --save-dev @ayx/ayx-scripts
```

See the [ayx-scripts](https://git.alteryx.com/ayx-ui/ayx-scripts) project for more details.
